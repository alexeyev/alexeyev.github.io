title: mystem-scala release
---

So happy to announce [mystem-scala:0.1.3](https://github.com/alexeyev/mystem-scala) (0.1.2 was not really usable) has been finally deployed to [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|ru.stachek66.nlp|mystem-scala|0.1.3|jar).

There are more features that can be implemented, so I would be happy to receive any kind of feedback: code reviews, feature requests, pull requests, warm letters of thanks, pints of beers of thanks.
