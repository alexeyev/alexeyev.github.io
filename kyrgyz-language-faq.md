### Frequently Asked Questions

These are my responses to questions I am tired of answering repeatedly.

---

#### Whatâ€™s so special about the Kyrgyz language? Does it require any unique NLP methods?

The best answer I can give so far is our [paper on Kyrgyz NLProc](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05503), particularly sections 3 and 4.

#### Do you speak Kyrgyz?

Not yet.

#### â€¦Then how can you work with the Kyrgyz language?!

NLP researchers often work with languages they donâ€™t speak. No one expects those developing models for hundreds of languages, or even working with extinct languages, to be fluent in all of them â€” so why is this *an issue for me*? ðŸ™‚  
That said, I only take criticism on this topic from those who have already contributed to Kyrgyz NLP. Otherwise, itâ€™s just gatekeeping, which is counterproductive given the current state of the field.  

Of course, there are limitations. I canâ€™t work on tasks requiring manual evaluation of colloquial usage, syntax nuances, or similar expertise. In such cases, I either avoid those tasks or collaborate with native speakers and language experts.

#### You collaborate with Kyrgyz institutions. Is your work motivated by Russiaâ€™s foreign affairs? (Why else would a Russian suddenly focus on Kyrgyzstan?)

I do research for the sake of research â€” mostly for the fun of it, not profit. Itâ€™s a rare privilege to work on something simply because you can and because you care. Iâ€™m also writing my doctoral thesis at KSTU n.a. I. Razzakov, and thatâ€™s the extent of it. Maybe I should care more about political implications, but I donâ€™t. See also my response to the last question.

#### Is your work motivated by non-Russian foreign affairs (since you promote working on Kyrgyz language tools)?

Actually, I work on Russian NLP as well!

Again, I donâ€™t care about such labels. I research for the sake of research â€” mostly for fun and personal interest. Itâ€™s a privilege to work on something purely because you care. Also, as mentioned, Iâ€™m writing my doctoral thesis at KSTU n.a. I. Razzakov. Thatâ€™s all there is to it. For more context, see the response to the last question.

#### Why did you choose Kyrgyz NLP?

This is by far the most common question. There are several reasons.

1. **Sentimental.**   Soviet philologist Roman Timenchik once said that itâ€™s a privilege to work in a field that allows you to express gratitude to entire cities, countries, and peoples. For him, this meant writing a book about Venice in Russian poetry. For me, NLP offers a similar opportunity. I want to create something meaningful in Kyrgyz NLP as a gesture of appreciation for a country and people who have given me so much â€” both inspiration and important moments in life.

2. **Exploration.**   Iâ€™ve always been interested in working with agglutinative languages. A few years ago, I even compiled an [awesome-azeri-nlp list](https://github.com/alexeyev/awesome-azeri-nlp) of language resources for the Azerbaijani language. Kyrgyz is a perfect candidate to delve into this area.

3. **Opportunity.**    Kyrgyz is a low-resource language, which means thereâ€™s a lot to do for a computational linguist and NLP practitioner. This is an excellent chance to learn by doing and make meaningful contributions across various subdomains of NLP.

4. **Collaboration.**   Working on a language you donâ€™t speak naturally requires collaboration. I genuinely enjoy working with the local AI community, contributing where I can, and learning together. Itâ€™s a rewarding experience both professionally and personally.
