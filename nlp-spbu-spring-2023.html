	<h4>Exam questions</h4>
	<ol>
<li> Zipf's Law, its importance for NLP. Language processing in information retrieval: lemmatization, 
	stemming, Boolean search, inverted indices, execution of Boolean queries on them, skip-lists.
<li> Language processing in information retrieval: vector space model, cosine distance, TF-IDF.
	Common ways of representing texts for machine learning tasks.
<li> Neural Networks: core principles, backpropagation, common optimizers, regularization techniques.
<li>  String distances and the algorithms for their computation: the Hamming distance, the Jaro-Winkler distance, 
	the Levenshtein distance, the longest common subsequence, the Jaccard distance for character N-grams. 
	Indices for typos detection/correction in words.
